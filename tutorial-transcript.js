Units, modules, and sections can all contain pages with course content. If you want, you can rename these containers an overview to better fit your course structure. To set the structure of your course, you can start by creating a unit. Click "create a unit", your unit will be created with the default name "Unit 1: unit". Torus numbers the units automatically. As to create or rearrange more units, Torus will update the numbering accordingly. To change the name of the unit, click the drop down menu and click "options", then change the title and click "save". Inside your unit, you can create a module. Following the same steps you used to create a unit, then inside of the module, you can create a section. Again, following the same steps you use to create a unit. You can create as many units, modules, and sections as you need for your course structure. You can also create pages at any level of the structure inside of a section, a module, a unit, or at the top level of your curriculum.`
