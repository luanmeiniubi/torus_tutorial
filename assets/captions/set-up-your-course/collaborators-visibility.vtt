00:00:00.409 --> 00:00:02.809
If you're working on a collaborative project,

1
00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.929
you can invite team members as collaborators.

2
00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:07.900
When you add a collaborator,

3
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.340
they will receive an email invitation.

4
00:00:11.489 --> 00:00:12.760
And once they accept it,

5
00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:15.460
they will gain editing access to the course.

6
00:00:16.409 --> 00:00:18.440
Keep in mind that tourists will not allow

7
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.500
multiple users to edit the same page concurrently.

8
00:00:21.879 --> 00:00:25.239
A user editing a page must leave that page before any

9
00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:28.760
other project collaborators can begin to edit the same page.

10
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.680
Remember to communicate and coordinate with your collaborators.

11
00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.319
Once you have developed your course,

12
00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:38.299
you will likely want to deliver it to students.

13
00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:39.500
In tour,

14
00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:43.959
this is done by creating course sections from the project you author.

15
00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.400
Students can then enroll in a course section to take the course.

16
00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.369
The publishing visibility setting controls who will be

17
00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:55.430
able to create co sections from your project.

18
00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:57.389
Under the default setting,

19
00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:59.130
project authors,

20
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.169
only you and your collaborators will be able

21
00:01:02.169 --> 00:01:05.029
to use your project to create core sections.

22
00:01:05.698 --> 00:01:06.448
Open

23
00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:10.749
will allow any instructor to create a course section from your project.

24
00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:13.848
Restricted allows you to grant permission

25
00:01:13.848 --> 00:01:17.308
to specific offering accounts or institutions.

26
00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:19.359
Once you set the basic details,

27
00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:22.268
you can continue with developing your course.

28
00:01:22.808 --> 00:01:26.348
You can return to adjust any overview settings at any time.

29
00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:28.878
To learn more about other available settings,

30
00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:30.958
you can check out discussion notes,

31
00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:33.429
surveys and transfer payment codes.
