00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.360
When you enter a course,

1
00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:04.389
you will be taken to the overview page for that course.

2
00:00:04.769 --> 00:00:09.350
Here you can enter and adjust some basic information and settings for your course.

3
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.649
The first step is setting up your project title,

4
00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:15.479
which you already entered when creating the course.

5
00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:17.590
You can change this at any time.

6
00:00:17.889 --> 00:00:18.280
Next,

7
00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:22.750
it's recommended to add a project description to provide context for your course.

8
00:00:23.129 --> 00:00:25.190
If you're designing a language course,

9
00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:27.510
you may want to adjust the learning language

10
00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:29.329
on the project attributes.

11
00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.240
If you're designing a course with course specific

12
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.759
names for the structural elements of units,

13
00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:36.479
modules,

14
00:00:36.599 --> 00:00:37.389
sections,

15
00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.819
you may want to adjust the project labels

16
00:00:39.959 --> 00:00:41.869
to customize these containers.
