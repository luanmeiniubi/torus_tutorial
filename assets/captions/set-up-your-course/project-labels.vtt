Torus follows a default hierarchy of units,

1
00:00:03.759 --> 00:00:04.400
modules,

2
00:00:04.599 --> 00:00:05.340
sections,

3
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.500
where a unit can contain multiple modules

4
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.220
and a module can contain multiple sections.

5
00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:12.680
Units,

6
00:00:12.819 --> 00:00:13.279
modules,

7
00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:14.159
and sections

8
00:00:14.359 --> 00:00:17.000
can all contain pages with course content.

9
00:00:18.239 --> 00:00:22.020
You can rename these containers to better fit your course structure.

10
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.409
For example,

11
00:00:23.559 --> 00:00:26.340
if your course is structured by weeks,

12
00:00:26.639 --> 00:00:29.040
you can rename units to weeks

13
00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:32.220
to reflect the weekly progression of your lessons.

14
00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.750
If you're designing a language course,

15
00:00:34.919 --> 00:00:37.259
you can rename these structural containers

16
00:00:37.389 --> 00:00:38.659
in your target language.
