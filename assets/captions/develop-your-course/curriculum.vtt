00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:07.869
Remember,

00:00:08.148 --> 00:00:10.180
Torus follows a default hierarchy

4
00:00:10.439 --> 00:00:11.199
of units,

00:00:11.359 --> 00:00:12.000
modules,

6
00:00:12.159 --> 00:00:13.020
sections.

7
00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:15.659
Where a unit contains multiple modules,

8
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.069
a module can contain multiple sections.

9
00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:19.239
Units,

10
00:00:19.309 --> 00:00:19.920
modules,

11
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.299
and sections can all contain pages with course content.

12
00:00:24.059 --> 00:00:24.790
If you want,

13
00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:27.610
you can rename these containers an overview

14
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.489
to better fit your course structure.

15
00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:32.180
To set the structure of your course,

16
00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:34.250
you can start by creating a unit.

17
00:00:35.189 --> 00:00:36.950
Click create a unit.

18
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.209
Your unit will be created

19
00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.700
with the default name Unit 1 unit.

20
00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:46.450
Taurus numbers the units automatically.

21
00:00:47.189 --> 00:00:49.770
As to create or rearrange more units,

22
00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.479
Torus will update the numbering accordingly.

23
00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:55.430
To change the name of the unit,

24
00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.330
click the drop down menu

25
00:00:57.669 --> 00:00:58.840
and click options,

26
00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:00.450
then change the title

27
00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:02.090
and click save.

28
00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.470
Inside your unit,

29
00:01:05.769 --> 00:01:07.029
you can create a module.

30
00:01:08.269 --> 00:01:11.180
Following the same steps you use to create a unit,

31
00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.099
then inside of the module,

32
00:01:13.309 --> 00:01:14.730
you can create a section.

33
00:01:15.639 --> 00:01:16.040
Again,

34
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.629
following the same steps you use to create a unit.

35
00:01:19.529 --> 00:01:21.169
You can create as many units,

36
00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:21.870
modules,

37
00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:24.830
and sections as you need for your course structure.

38
00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.370
You can also create pages at any level of the structure.

39
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.620
Inside of a section,

40
00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.300
a module,

41
00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.980
a unit,

42
00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.519
or at the top level of your curriculum.
